## ðŸ§  What is Linear Algebra?

Linear Algebra is the branch of mathematics concerned with:
- Vectors
- Matrices
- Vector spaces
- Linear transformations
- Systems of linear equations

> In short: itâ€™s the math of "things that can be added and scaled."

## ðŸŽ¯ Why is Linear Algebra Important for Data Science?

| Area | Application |
|------|-------------|
| Machine Learning | Matrix ops, gradient descent, backprop |
| Data Analysis | PCA, projections, SVD |
| NLP | Word vectors, vector spaces |
| Deep Learning | Tensor algebra, weight matrices |
| Image Processing | SVD, transformations |
| Optimization | Linear constraints, Jacobians, Hessians |

## ðŸ“š Before You Begin: Core Concepts

### âž¤ Scalar
A single number. E.g., `3`

### âž¤ Vector
An ordered list of numbers (like a point or arrow). E.g., `v = [1, 2, 3]`

### âž¤ Matrix
A rectangular array of numbers. E.g.,  
```
A = [[1, 2],
     [3, 4]]
```

### âž¤ Linear Combination
Any expression like:  
`a*v1 + b*v2 + c*v3`

### âž¤ Span
All possible linear combinations of a set of vectors.

### âž¤ Vector Space
A set of vectors that is closed under:
- Vector addition
- Scalar multiplication  
(Follows 8 axioms â€” will cover in Module 1)
